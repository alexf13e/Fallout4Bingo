            <h1>Welcome to Fallout 4 Bingo</h1>
            <p>The goal is to complete the objectives provided in the grid. Clicking an objective marks it as complete,
                and completing any row, column or corner-to-corner diagonal wins the game and stops the timer.
                If you die or load a save, the lost progress should be removed from the board, so I recommend saving after
                each objective. For this reason I also recommend not playing on survival unless you use a mod to allow saving.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game should be played on a fresh character, and started from just before leaving the vault at the elevator.
                This means you can start the timer and have a chance to change special points after looking at the board
                if you would like, and serves as a standard starting point if you want to compare times with others. There
                are no objectives in the pre-war/vault sequence. Some objectives require doing something multiple times
                (such as collecting 5 of an item), these count your progress each time you click the objective. If you
                misclick and need to undo completing an objective, either click the objective again or click the minus
                button if it is one with more than one level of completion.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you would like to play in real-time against a friend, I recommend looking at
                <a href="https://bingosync.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bingo Sync</a>. They don't have
                an existing Fallout 4 board, so you can copy the objectives by clicking
                <a class="textButton" onclick="getObjectives()">here</a>. Then on BingoSync, make a new room and scroll
                to the bottom of the list of games and select "Custom (Advanced)". Then paste the objectives into the
                board textbox, and set variant to "Randomized". The site doesn't have progress tracking for objectives
                or a timer, so you'd need to keep track of those yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, consider trying my Geoguesser game for Fallout 4

            <p>
                Upload a file containing your own objectives, or paste them in the text box.<br>
                Objectives must be formatted either as one line per objective (these will be created with a single level
                of completion), or an array of JSON objects. You must enter at least 25 objectives.
            </p>
            <span>
                <label for="inpObjectives">Import custom objectives</label>
                <input type="file" id="inpFileObjectives" name="inpObjectives" accept=".txt,.json" onchange="importObjectives()">
            </span>
            <textarea id="inpTextObjectives"  rows="14" placeholder='Example JSON format:
[
    {
        "name": "text to be shown on the objective square",
        "amount": 3
    },
    {
        "name": "text to be shown on the objective square",
        "amount": 1
    }
]
The "amount" field is optional, an objective with no amount or an amount of 1 will be set to have a single
level of completion.'
