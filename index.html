            <h1>Welcome to Fallout 4 Bingo</h1>
            <p>The goal is to complete the objectives provided in the grid. Clicking an objective marks it
                as complete, and completing any row, column or corner-to-corner diagonal wins the game and stops the timer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some objectives require doing something multiple times (such as collecting 5 of an item), these count your
                progress each time you click the objective. If you misclick and need to undo completing an objective, either
                click the objective again or click the minus button if it is one with more than one level of completion.
                The game should be played on a fresh character, and started from just before leaving the vault. This means
                you can start the timer and look at the board to have a chance to change special points if you would like, and
                serves as a standard starting point if you want to compare times with others. There are no objectives in the
                pre-war/vault sequence.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you would like to play in real-time against a friend, I recommend looking at
                <a href="https://bingosync.com/">Bingo Sync</a>. They don't have an existing Fallout 4 board, so you can copy
                the objectives by clicking <a class="textButton" onclick="getObjectives()">here</a>. Then on BingoSync, scroll
                to the bottom of the list of games and select "Custom (Advanced)". Then paste the objectives into the board
                textbox, and set variant to "Randomized". The site doesn't have progress tracking for objectives or a
                timer, so you'll have to keep track of those yourself.
